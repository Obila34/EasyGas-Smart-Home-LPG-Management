# EasyGas - Smart Home LPG Management System

A comprehensive IoT solution for monitoring and managing LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) consumption in smart homes. This system provides real-time monitoring, automated alerts, and intelligent management of LPG usage through connected sensors and smart applications.

## 🏠 Overview

EasyGas is designed to make LPG management safer, smarter, and more efficient for modern homes. The system monitors gas levels, detects leaks, tracks consumption patterns, and provides predictive analytics for gas refill scheduling.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of LPG levels and consumption
- **Smart Alerts**: Automated notifications for low gas levels, leaks, and maintenance
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-driven insights for consumption patterns and refill scheduling
- **Mobile & Web Apps**: User-friendly interfaces for monitoring and control
- **Safety First**: Advanced leak detection and emergency shutdown capabilities
- **Cost Optimization**: Track usage patterns to optimize gas consumption and costs

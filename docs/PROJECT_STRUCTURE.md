## üì± Application Workflows

### Device Registration Flow
1. Hardware device broadcasts pairing signal
2. Mobile app detects and connects to device
3. User configures device settings via app
4. Device registers with backend services
5. Monitoring begins automatically

### Alert Generation Flow
1. Sensor detects anomaly (low gas/leak)
2. Controller processes and validates data
3. Alert sent to backend via secure channel
4. Backend triggers notification services
5. Push notification sent to mobile app
6. Email/SMS alerts sent if configured

### Data Analytics Flow
1. Continuous sensor data collection
2. Real-time data streaming to analytics engine
3. ML models process consumption patterns
4. Predictive insights generated
5. Recommendations sent to user applications

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards
- Use ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document all public APIs

### Version Control
- Use feature branches for development
- Require pull request reviews
- Maintain semantic versioning
- Tag releases appropriately

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows

### Security Considerations
- Encrypt all data in transit and at rest
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Mock hardware simulators for testing
- Local databases and services

### Staging Environment
- Cloud-based deployment (AWS/Azure)
- Production-like data and configurations
- Automated testing and validation

### Production Environment
- Highly available cloud deployment
- Auto-scaling and load balancing
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery and backup systems

This structure ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns across all project components.

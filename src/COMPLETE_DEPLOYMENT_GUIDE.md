   ```

## Phase 2: Optional Backend Enhancement (For Advanced Features)

### Step 3: Supabase Setup (Optional - for Real Data Storage)

**⚠️ Note: Your app works perfectly without this step!**

Only set up Supabase if you want to:
- Store real order data
- Enable multi-device synchronization
- Add user authentication
- Scale to multiple users

1. **Create Supabase Project** (if desired):
   ```bash
   # Go to https://supabase.com (free tier available)
   # Create new project: "easygas-smart-home"
   # Note your Project URL and API keys
   # The app will automatically detect and use the backend
   ```

2. **Backend Status Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Without Supabase: 🟡 "Offline Mode - Simulated Data"
   # With Supabase: 🟢 "Backend Connected"
   # Both modes are fully functional!
   ```

### Step 2: Twilio Account Setup

1. **Create Twilio Account**
   ```bash
   # Go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
   # Sign up for free account ($15 credit included)
   # Verify your phone number
   # Complete account setup
   ```

2. **Get Twilio Credentials**
   ```bash
   # From Twilio Console Dashboard, note down:
   # - Account SID (starts with AC...)
   # - Auth Token (click to reveal)
   # - Your Twilio phone number (format: +1234567890)
   ```

3. **Configure Phone Numbers**
   ```bash
   # Set up your emergency contact number
   # Format: +[country code][number] (e.g., +254712345678 for Kenya)
   # Ensure the number is verified in Twilio for trial accounts
   ```

   # "=== EasyGas ESP32 System Starting ==="
   # "WiFi connected!"
   # "IP address: [your ESP32 IP]"
   # "✅ API connection successful!"
   # "EasyGas ESP32 initialized and ready!"
   ```

3. **Ultrasonic Sensor Calibration**
   ```bash
   # CRITICAL: Measure your actual gas cylinder:
   # 1. Total internal height (typically 30cm for 14.2kg)
   # 2. Distance when empty (sensor to bottom)
   # 3. Distance when full (sensor to liquid surface)
   
   # Update calibration in generated firmware:
   const float CYLINDER_HEIGHT_CM = 30.0;    // Your cylinder height
   const float EMPTY_DISTANCE_CM = 28.0;     // Distance when empty
   const float FULL_DISTANCE_CM = 3.0;       // Distance when full
   ```

4. **Gas Sensor Calibration**
   ```bash
   # 1. Let MQ-5 sensor warm up for 5 minutes in clean air
   # 2. Note the baseline voltage in Serial Monitor
   # 3. Test with lighter gas (SAFELY - no ignition!)
   # 4. Adjust LEAK_THRESHOLD if needed (default 1.5V)
   ```

5. **Web App Integration Test**
   ```bash
   # In your web dashboard:
   # 1. Check "Live Status" shows current readings
   # 2. Click "Send Test Command" button
   # 3. Verify ESP32 receives and responds
   # 4. Monitor gas level updates in real-time
   ```

6. **Emergency System Test**
   ```bash
   # SAFETY FIRST - Controlled environment only:
   # 1. Briefly expose MQ-5 to lighter gas (no flame!)
   # 2. ESP32 LED should flash rapidly + buzzer sounds
   # 3. Web app should show "LEAK DETECTED" alert
   # 4. Check SMS received on emergency number
   # 5. Verify voice call placed (if Twilio configured)
   # 6. Remove gas source - system should reset
   ```

   # 2. Review and analyze usage patterns
   # 3. Check Supabase storage usage
   # 4. Test full emergency protocol
   # 5. Backup critical data
   ```

3. **Sensor Maintenance**
   ```bash
   # MQ-5 Gas Sensor:
   # - Clean sensor periodically with dry brush
   # - Replace every 2-3 years or if sensitivity decreases
   
   # Ultrasonic Sensor:
   # - Clean sensor face with soft cloth
   # - Check for physical damage
   ```

### Step 11: Troubleshooting Guide

1. **ESP32 Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Symptoms: "WiFi disconnected" messages
   # Solutions:
   # 1. Check WiFi credentials in firmware
   # 2. Verify router settings (2.4GHz band)
   # 3. Check signal strength at ESP32 location
   # 4. Restart router and ESP32
   ```

2. **API Call Failures**
   ```bash
   # Symptoms: "Failed to fetch" errors in web app
   # Solutions:
   # 1. Check Supabase project status
   # 2. Verify API keys are correct
   # 3. Check CORS settings in server
   # 4. Test endpoints manually with curl
   ```

3. **Emergency Alert Failures**
   ```bash
   # Symptoms: No SMS/calls during gas leak
   # Solutions:
   # 1. Check Twilio account balance
   # 2. Verify phone numbers are correct format
   # 3. Check trial account limitations
   # 4. Test Twilio API manually
   ```

## Security Considerations

### Step 12: Security Hardening

1. **API Security**
   ```bash
   # - Use HTTPS only for all communications
   # - Rotate API keys regularly
   # - Implement rate limiting if needed
   # - Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
   ```

2. **ESP32 Security**
   ```bash
   # - Use WPA2/WPA3 WiFi encryption
   # - Change default ESP32 credentials
   # - Keep firmware updated
   # - Secure physical access to device
   ```

3. **Twilio Security**
   ```bash
   # - Store auth tokens securely
   # - Use webhook authentication if implementing webhooks
   # - Monitor account for unauthorized usage
   # - Enable two-factor authentication
   ```

## Cost Optimization

### Step 13: Production Cost Management

1. **Supabase Costs**
   ```bash
   # Free tier includes:
   # - 500MB database storage
   # - 2GB bandwidth per month
   # - 500k function invocations per month
   
   # Monitor usage and upgrade if needed
   ```

2. **Twilio Costs**
   ```bash
   # Typical costs:
   # - SMS: $0.0075 per message
   # - Voice calls: $0.0130 per minute
   # - Phone number rental: $1.00 per month
   
   # Optimize by limiting emergency calls to critical events
   ```

3. **Hosting Costs**
   ```bash
   # Vercel/Netlify free tiers are sufficient for personal use
   # Upgrade only if you need custom domains or high bandwidth
   ```

## Scaling Considerations

### Step 14: Multi-Device Setup

1. **Multiple ESP32 Devices**
   ```bash
   # Modify ESP32 firmware to include device ID:
   const char* deviceId = "kitchen-gas-monitor";
   
   # Update backend to handle multiple devices
   # Add device management in web app
   ```

2. **Family/Business Deployment**
   ```bash
   # - Implement user authentication
   # - Add device grouping functionality
   # - Create admin dashboard for multiple properties
   # - Scale Twilio to handle multiple emergency contacts
   ```
